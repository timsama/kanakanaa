**Kanji and Autocomplete Text:** This package contains a reshaped JSON-repackaged subset of the [JMdict/EDICT](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project) and [KANJIDIC](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project) dictionary files. These files are the property of the [Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group](http://www.edrdg.org/), and are used in conformance with the Group's [licence](http://www.edrdg.org/edrdg/licence.html).

**JSON LUA Library:** Due to some problems using the official Windower JSON library, this package uses [json.lua]([https://github.com/rxi/json.lua](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua)) under The MIT License as its JSON parser. See rxijson.lua, or the linked github page for additional details.
